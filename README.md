## Summary

Create a beautiful, calming Mood Garden web app - a digital sanctuary where users grow flowers based on their emotions!

ðŸŒ¸ CONCEPT:
Click anywhere to plant a flower seed. Each click creates a flower that grows and blooms over 3-4 seconds with smooth animation. The flowers gently sway in an invisible breeze. Users can create their own personal garden of emotions.

âœ¨ VISUAL DESIGN:
- Soft gradient background: dawn colors (soft pink to lavender to light blue)
- Ground line at bottom with grass texture or gradient
- Flowers have stems, leaves, and colorful petals
- Each flower is randomly one of 6 colors:
  * Red (passion) - bold red petals
  * Yellow (joy) - bright yellow petals  
  * Blue (calm) - serene blue petals
  * Purple (creative) - mystical purple petals
  * Orange (energetic) - vibrant orange petals
  * Pink (love) - soft pink petals
- Flowers gently sway and petals rotate slightly (CSS animations)
- Subtle sparkle effects when flowers bloom
- Soft shadows under flowers

ðŸŽ® INTERACTIONS:
- Click anywhere on canvas to plant a seed
- Seed sprouts â†’ grows stem â†’ grows leaves â†’ blooms petals (smooth animation)
- Flowers stay permanent once planted
- Hover over flowers to make them glow slightly
- Each flower shows a small emotion label when hovered (e.g., 'Joy', 'Calm')

ðŸŽ¨ MINIMAL UI (top-right corner, elegant):
- Flower count: "ðŸŒ¸ 12 flowers"
- "Clear Garden" button (small, transparent)
- "What's your mood?" text at top center (fade out after 3 seconds)

ðŸŽµ AMBIENT DETAILS:
- Occasional butterflies float across (optional CSS animation)
- Sun or moon in corner (based on time of day)
- Clouds drift slowly in background (optional)
- Grass/ground that flowers grow from

ðŸ’« STARTING STATE:
- Empty garden with just the background
- Prompt text: "Click to plant a flower and grow your mood garden âœ¨"
- Maybe 1-2 flowers already planted as examples

The vibe should be: peaceful, therapeutic, creative, satisfying to watch flowers grow. Like a digital zen garden meets emotional expression.
